Last.fm libraries for Codeigniter
=================================

A rudimentary hammering of PHP-Last.fm-API (https://github.com/matto1990/PHP-Last.fm-API) into a Codeigniter formula.

Data base connectivity has been refactored the most to fit Codeigniter's active record methodology and multi-database support.

Developed with Codeigniter 2.2.1, using Sqlite and MySQL.

2 example controllers are supplied, refer to original repository, and of course, Last.fm's API pages for more detail on methods.
